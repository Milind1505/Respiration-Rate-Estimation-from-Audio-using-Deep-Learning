# Respiration-Rate-Estimation-from-Audio-using-Deep-Learning
A machine learning prototype using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to estimate respiration rate from audio recordings. This project explores the feasibility of non-contact respiratory monitoring using deep learning with synthetic data, laying the groundwork for future real-world applications and wearable integration.
