# Respiration-Rate-Estimation-from-Audio-using-Deep-Learning
A machine learning prototype using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to estimate respiration rate from audio recordings. This project explores the feasibility of non-contact respiratory monitoring using deep learning with synthetic data, laying the groundwork for future real-world applications and wearable integration.

Project Overview: 

This repository demonstrates a machine learning system that estimates respiration rate (breaths per minute) from audio recordings of breathing. By turning sound into health insights, this prototype illustrates how AI-powered signal processing can transform everyday devices (like earbuds or smartphones) into non-invasive health monitors.

Goal:

Build a deep learning pipeline to estimate respiration rate from audio signals.
Explore synthetic breathing data generation as a stand-in for limited datasets.
Apply signal processing + ML to extract useful features (waveforms, spectrograms, MFCCs).
Train and evaluate 1D-CNN and LSTM models for accurate respiration rate regression.
Demonstrate clinical relevance with plots of predicted vs. ground truth rates.
Set the foundation for multi-task health sensing (e.g., HR, HRV, Respiration) on wearables.

Motivation: 

Respiratory rate is a vital sign alongside heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. Abnormal breathing (too fast, too slow, or irregular) can indicate:
Respiratory infections (e.g., pneumonia, COVID-19).
Chronic diseases like asthma and COPD.
Cardiovascular issues and pleural effusion.
Early signs of clinical deterioration.
Traditionally, monitoring respiration requires clinical-grade sensors (respiratory belts, capnography). These are expensive, intrusive, and impractical for everyday use.

Approach:

Preprocess audio into waveform segments or spectrograms.
Train a 1D-CNN or LSTM model to regress breaths per minute.
Validate performance against test data.
Visualize predictions vs. ground truth.
This project aligns with health-tech applications such as:
Non-invasive respiratory monitoring.
Early detection of abnormal breathing patterns.
Complementary tool for conditions like asthma, COPD, or pleural effusion where tracking respiratory changes is important.

Setup & Requirements
This project was built and tested in Google Colab.
Install Dependencies:

    pip install tensorflow keras librosa matplotlib pandas numpy scipy seaborn

Data
You can start with synthetic breathing audio (simulated sinusoidal waveforms with noise).
Or, replace with real-world datasets such as:
Sleep-EDF Database
Respiratory Sound Database
Snoring/breathing recordings available on PhysioNet/Kaggle.
Preprocessing Steps:
Normalize audio.
Segment into fixed windows (e.g., 10s).
Convert to spectrograms or MFCC features.

Model Architecture
Option 1: 1D-CNN
Learns filters directly on waveform/spectrogram sequences.
Captures local patterns in breathing cycles.

Architecture Example:

    Input (spectrogram segment) → Conv1D → MaxPooling → Conv1D → Flatten → Dense → Output (BPM)

Option 2: LSTM/GRU
Models temporal dependencies across multiple breathing cycles.
Useful for irregular patterns or sleep breathing analysis.

    Input (sequence) → LSTM layers → Dense → Output (BPM)

Training
Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Optimizer: Adam.
Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R² Score.
Training/Evaluation Split: 80/20.

Results
Training demonstrates the model can approximate respiration rate with synthetic and/or real data.
Example outputs:

    Test Sample 1: Predicted = 18.2 BPM | True = 19 BPM
    Test Sample 2: Predicted = 12.7 BPM | True = 13 BPM
    Test Sample 3: Predicted = 21.1 BPM | True = 22 BPM

Visualization of predicted vs. ground truth breathing rates shows good alignment.

Applications
Continuous, non-invasive monitoring of breathing.
Early warning for respiratory distress in conditions like asthma, COPD, or pleural effusion.
Integration with wearables/earbuds for at-home monitoring.
Foundation for anomaly detection: shallow breathing, apnea events, or irregular respiration.

Next Steps
Train on real breathing datasets for clinical-grade validation.
Add anomaly detection for irregular breathing patterns.
Optimize models for on-device deployment (TinyML, TensorFlow Lite, ExecuTorch).
Explore multi-task models that jointly estimate HR, HRV, and respiration from the same audio input.
