# Respiration-Rate-Estimation-from-Audio-using-Deep-Learning
A machine learning prototype using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to estimate respiration rate from audio recordings. This project explores the feasibility of non-contact respiratory monitoring using deep learning with synthetic data, laying the groundwork for future real-world applications and wearable integration.

Project Overview
Goal: Build a machine learning model that takes audio recordings of breathing and predicts the user’s respiration rate.
Approach:
Preprocess audio into waveform segments or spectrograms.
Train a 1D-CNN or LSTM model to regress breaths per minute.
Validate performance against test data.
Visualize predictions vs. ground truth.
This project aligns with health-tech applications such as:
Non-invasive respiratory monitoring.
Early detection of abnormal breathing patterns.
Complementary tool for conditions like asthma, COPD, or pleural effusion where tracking respiratory changes is important.

Setup & Requirements
This project was built and tested in Google Colab.
Dependencies:
Python 3.8+
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Librosa (for audio processing)
Scipy

pip install tensorflow librosa matplotlib pandas numpy scipy

Data
You can start with synthetic breathing audio (simulated sinusoidal waveforms with noise).
Or, replace with real-world datasets such as:
Sleep-EDF Database
Respiratory Sound Database
Snoring/breathing recordings available on PhysioNet/Kaggle.
Preprocessing Steps:
Normalize audio.
Segment into fixed windows (e.g., 10s).
Convert to spectrograms or MFCC features.

Model Architecture
Option 1: 1D-CNN
Learns temporal filters directly from raw waveforms.
Option 2: LSTM/GRU
Captures sequential dependencies in breathing cycles.
Output Layer: Single neuron predicting respiration rate (breaths per minute).

Results
Training demonstrates the model can approximate respiration rate with synthetic and/or real data.
Example outputs:

Test Sample 1: Predicted = 18.2 BPM | True = 19 BPM
Test Sample 2: Predicted = 12.7 BPM | True = 13 BPM
Test Sample 3: Predicted = 21.1 BPM | True = 22 BPM

Visualization of predicted vs. ground truth breathing rates shows good alignment.

Applications
Continuous, non-invasive monitoring of breathing.
Early warning for respiratory distress in conditions like asthma, COPD, or pleural effusion.
Integration with wearables/earbuds for at-home monitoring.
Foundation for anomaly detection: shallow breathing, apnea events, or irregular respiration.

Next Steps
Train on real breathing datasets for clinical-grade validation.
Add anomaly detection for irregular breathing patterns.
Optimize models for on-device deployment (TinyML, TensorFlow Lite, ExecuTorch).
Explore multi-task models that jointly estimate HR, HRV, and respiration from the same audio input.
